# Tyke Blue 2019 State of the Union 😜

## Tyke Blue 2019

Let me start by saying thanks to all of you for everything thus far. All the parental help getting the kids out to games/practices, all the coaching help from my assistant team, and the managerial help from Chris. It takes a village! Been great so far and I am looking forward to the second half.

Being a rookie head coach coming into the season, I had my worries about the unknowns, and how everything was going to work out, but it has been great. We all have grown and learned together, and I can definitely say I am happy with our progression. I do feel blessed to have the opportunity to work with such a great group of kids. They make me better, and I hope they are also feeling positive about the relationship. They still smile at me, so I'm doing something right I guess 👍

# Recap

We started off with a great preseason, playing Thornhill Blue, West Mall and then finally Humber Valley White. The boys had fun, and it was a great way to work out all of the kinks. We also learned what it was going to be like playing West Mall!

We started the NYHL Fall Season off great. The first 2 games against HV White and Duffield White showed that we were a step ahead. Then better against West Mall, but they are still a step ahead. A tight loss against Faustina Black and then two dead locked games against Thornhill Red; definitely the closest match in skill to us thus far.

West Hill showed they are shooting for top of the top, at all costs 👎; and West Mall was  
still just a little too tough for us; their goalie making it ever more difficult. But I think  
those challenging games make the boys a little more prepared for the next challenge. Fighting  
through those hard games is not easy, and now they know that.

There was another game against Vaughan Red in there and we were a step ahead on that day.   

So all in all a great 10 games, and a middle of the pack finish. Well done 👍

## Tyke Blue Growth
I think the boys are growing well and getting better for the following reasons:

- Their positioning on the ice is better; a little less puck chasing
- They are better understanding the various hockey positions
- They are passing and working together
- They are supporting each other
- Their skating is better; shots are better

I started this weekends practice with detailed edge work for one or our stations. I felt like it went well and I was getting somewhere with the boys. So I plan to continue this training tract and hopefully move the boys detailed skating forward. Other plans for the remainder of the season:

- Tournament Don Montgomery; early January
- Social for the end of January/Beginning of February
- Additional ice times each month to get in Fun and Training
- Improving the impact of the Skills Coaches with the boys
- Increasing the boys hockey IQ; skills and confidence
- Hopefully earning our share of wins for the remainder of games/playoffs; having FUN!

## Tyke Blue 2020
Into the winter season the following changes are coming which you should understand:

- We have been placed into Tier 2, Group B with;
	- Don Mills (up from Tier 3)
	- Vaughan Red (whom we know from Fall Season)
	- Thornhill Red (whom we know from Fall Season)
	- Faustina Black (whom we know from Fall Season)
- Probably a game ++ with each of those teams and then playoffs. This will be a home & home
against one of our division rivals. 

From here we have tryouts for the U7 2020/2021 teams.

## U7 2020/2021
2020/2021 season things you need to know:

- The divisions will be renamed according to age -> as seen in soccer: U9(Novice), U11(Atom)
- Tryouts will be moved to early September, following 4 practice sessions.

See the very recent release on the changes from the [OMHA](https://www.omha.net/news_article/show/1073503)

## Wrap Up
So there are big changes coming next season that I’m sure everyone will have questions about. But we will endeavour to improve and get better every day with our remaining time together this season. Any questions let me know and Happy Holidays to Everyone!
