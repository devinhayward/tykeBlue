## Bulldogs Final Push/Update

So as we move into February and the end of the season push, I wanted to write a blog to lay out all of the information.

### NYHL Winter Season Close Out/Playoffs

We close out our winter season with three more games:
- Tomorrow vs Faustina Black
- Tuesday Feb_18 vs Thornhill Red
- Sunday Feb_23 vs Don Mills

We then begin the playoffs, games TBD. Playoffs consist of a round robin format first, playing each of the teams in Group B once. The top two teams in our group will advance to the next round. The knockout round consists of:

- Group A - 1st vs Group B - 2nd; 3 game series; first to 4 points
- Group B - 1st vs Group A - 2nd; 3 game series; first to 4 points

Finals are the winners of the semis, 3 game series; first to 4 points.

This will close out our season.

### U8 Minor Novice 2020/2021

At the conclusion of our playoff run, and the completion of House League and Little Stanley Cup Day at EY, you will have your spring and summer to relax and play other sports. The ramp up for next season will begin in August. The Hockey Canada pathways extend to U11 Atom starting next season so our Boys move to the GTHL in 2022 will be under the U11 Pathway. The details for the U8 pathway are below:

- 4 practice/skill sessions will be offered at the end of August and first week of school  
following Labour Day
- 3 formal evaluation/tiering sessions will follow the 2nd week of school to properly evaluate  
and tier the boys into a U8 Blue & U8 Gold teams
- evaluations will consist of 1 skills session; 1 small area games session; 1 game
- fair & equal ice time; players play all positions; no full time goalies
- we will move from cross ice games to half ice games 4 on 4

### Final Thoughts

The extension of the Hockey Canada pathway in the U11 division this season is a drastic change for the GTHL, and will guarantee that our boys are protected from ourselves! They will be allowed to be boys, and play all positions, and learn the love the game from all angles. They can figure out where they fit into the on-ice world. They have learned a lot this season, and we will extend their learning next season. They are learning to compete as a team; play as a team and lose the selfish tendencies; their skating is improving and their stick skills the same; and most of all they are learning a love for the game and for their teammates. Teams support each other and work together to bring out the power of 4 vs the power of 1.

Any questions or thoughts let me, or any of the coaching team know. We are here to help.  
Hope to have a fun and exciting playoff to close out the season!
